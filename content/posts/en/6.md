## Recap of Part 1 {#recap}

From Part 1, we learned about the first three links:
- **Avijjā** → **Saṅkhārā** → **Viññāṇa**

Now we continue with links 4-8, which explain the process of the formation of body and mind.

## Links 4-6: Formation {#formation}

### Link 4: Nāmarūpa (Name and Form) {#namarupa}

**Nāmarūpa** means "name and form" or "mind and body"

- **Nāma** = The formless part: mind, feelings, thoughts
- **Rūpa** = The form part: physical, body

When there is Viññāṇa (consciousness) from a previous existence, it becomes bound to Nāmarūpa, a new being in a new existence.

### Link 5: Saḷāyatana (Six Sense Bases) {#six-sense-bases}

**Saḷāyatana** are the six internal sense bases:
1. Eye (Cakkhu)
2. Ear (Sota)
3. Nose (Ghāna)
4. Tongue (Jivhā)
5. Body (Kāya)
6. Mind (Mano)

When there is Nāmarūpa, Saḷāyatana develops, becoming doors to perceive the external world.

### Link 6: Phassa (Contact) {#contact}

**Phassa** is contact, the meeting

When an internal sense base (e.g., eye) meets an external object (e.g., form) and consciousness arises → **Phassa** occurs

**Formula:** Sense Base + Object + Consciousness = Contact

## Links 7-8: The Beginning of Suffering {#suffering-begins}

### Link 7: Vedanā (Feeling) {#feeling}

**Vedanā** is feeling, of three types:
- **Sukha Vedanā** - Pleasant feeling, satisfaction
- **Dukkha Vedanā** - Unpleasant feeling, dissatisfaction
- **Adukkhamasukha Vedanā** - Neutral feeling, neither pleasant nor unpleasant

When there is contact (Phassa), feeling (Vedanā) always follows.

### Link 8: Taṇhā (Craving) {#craving}

**Taṇhā** is craving, desire, divided into three types:

1. **Kāma Taṇhā** - Craving for sensual pleasures, wanting sensory satisfaction
2. **Bhava Taṇhā** - Craving for existence, wanting to be
3. **Vibhava Taṇhā** - Craving for non-existence, wanting to cease

> **This is the crucial point!**  
> When feeling arises, if there is no mindfulness, we immediately develop **Taṇhā**  
> - Pleasant feeling → We want more  
> - Unpleasant feeling → We want it to stop, want to escape

## The Turning Point {#turning-point}

**Phassa → Vedanā → Taṇhā** This is where we can stop the cycle of suffering!

If we have **mindfulness** at the point where feeling arises and do not let craving follow, the cycle will stop.

**Vipassanā** practice therefore focuses on being aware of feeling and not letting craving arise.

**Next Part:** We will learn about the final links (9-12) that lead to birth, aging, and death, and how to completely break this cycle.
