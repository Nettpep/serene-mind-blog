- Wake up and check phone first thing ✓

## Pro-Level Techniques {#pro-tips}

### 1. Phone Parking {#phone-parking}

Create a "phone parking spot" at home:
- Charging station in living room (not bedroom)
- When you get home → Put phone down
- **Live without it** until before bed

### 2. Grayscale Mode {#grayscale}

Change screen to black and white:
- iOS: Settings → Accessibility → Display → Color Filters
- Android: Settings → Accessibility → Vision → Grayscale

**Why:** Colors make brain addicted, no color = boring = use less

### 3. The 5-5-5 Rule {#555-rule}

Before picking up phone, ask yourself:
1. **5 seconds pause** - Take deep breath
2. **5 questions** - Why pick it up? Really necessary?
3. **5 minutes limit** - Set timer, finish and put down

---

## Mindful Technology {#mindful-tech}

### Principles of Mindful Technology Use {#principles}

1. **Intentional** - Clear purpose, not mindless use
2. **Balanced** - Not too much, not too little
3. **Present** - Focus on what you're doing, don't multitask
4. **Compassionate** - Use to create, not harm

### Apps That Help {#helpful-apps}

**Paradox:** Use apps to reduce app use 😄

- **Forest** - Grow virtual trees when not touching phone
- **Freedom** - Block websites/apps
- **Headspace** - Meditation and sleep
- **Moment** - Track usage and set goals

---

## Conclusion: Not Anti-Tech but Pro-Life {#conclusion}

**Digital Detox doesn't mean:**
- ❌ Abandon all technology
- ❌ Return to cave age
- ❌ Be a Luddite (technology opponent)

**But means:**
- ✓ Use technology mindfully
- ✓ Be master of devices, not slave
- ✓ Choose quality over quantity
- ✓ Use technology to enhance life, not replace it

### Final Question {#final-question}

> **If today were your last day  
> Would you want to spend time with screens or with loved ones?**

The answer is within you 🙏
