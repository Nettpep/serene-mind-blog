## Are We Chasing Success—or Being Chased by It? {#introduction}

Many of us start Monday morning full of determination. But by Wednesday afternoon, we find ourselves drowning in tasks and a strange feeling of emptiness. We follow every productivity formula, meticulously schedule our time—but why do we end up feeling more and more "burned out"?

In Buddhism, there is a teaching called **"Iddhipada 4"** (Iddhipada), often translated as "the path to success." But if we look deeper, Iddhipada 4 isn't just a secret formula for pumping out maximum output. It's about adjusting our "inner ecology" so that work and life flow smoothly and sustainably.

It consists of four interconnected qualities: **Chanda, Viriya, Citta, and Vimamsa.** Let's explore how, in this fast-paced world, we can use these principles to "embrace" our lives.

## Chanda: Loving What You Do—or Just "Wanting" the Outcome? {#chanda}

We are often taught to set goals (Goals) so intensely that sometimes we accidentally end up loving the "reward" more than we love "what's right in front of us."

**Chanda** is not craving—not the kind of desire that makes us restless. It is contentment, a genuine love for being with what we're doing.

Try asking yourself:

- Do I want to be a great writer—or do I just enjoy when people praise my writing?
- Do I want to solve this code problem—or am I just after the year-end bonus?

When we have **"true Chanda,"** we feel lighter. We're not working just to "get it done," but because we "see the value" in every line we write or every problem we solve. It's happiness that arises along the way—not waiting until we cross the finish line before allowing ourselves to be happy.

## Viriya: Effort That Is "Just Right," Like Tuning an Instrument {#viriya}

We often misunderstand **Viriya** as pushing harder—working late, skipping rest, forcing ourselves. But in reality, effort that lacks "love" (Chanda) often leads to exhaustion.

The Buddha once compared effort to tuning a lute: if the string is too tight, it snaps; if it's too loose, it won't make a sound.

**Right Viriya is "consistency."**

It's not running a 100-meter sprint and then collapsing. It's walking a marathon at a pace where your heart can beat normally.

- **Right Effort:** Knowing how much energy you have today, then doing your best within the limits that your body can handle.
- **Wrong Effort:** Forcing yourself to escape fear or to outdo others, until you ultimately lose balance in your life.

## Citta: Focus in a World Full of Distractions {#citta}

In an age where our attention is constantly pulled by notifications, **Citta** has become the most valuable skill of all.

**Citta** isn't about forcing yourself to concentrate until you're stressed. It's about having **"a mind that's present with the body" (Presence)**. When we work, our mind is with the work—not worrying about unanswered emails or anxious about what people think on social media.

Try noticing: when you work with "Citta," time passes very quickly (Flow State). That's because your mind isn't being divided elsewhere. This stillness itself is the birthplace of the greatest creative power.

---

## Vimamsa: Wisdom Through "Observation," Not "Blame" {#vimamsa}

Many times when we fail, we end up blaming ourselves. But **Vimamsa** invites us to look at what happened through the eyes of a curious scientist filled with compassion.

**Vimamsa** is reflection, contemplation, and improvement:

- "This approach didn't work. Is there another way?"
- "Why did I feel especially exhausted at that moment?"
- "How can I adjust my work process to make myself happier?"

It's about learning from mistakes without letting those mistakes define your worth. When we have Vimamsa, we won't fear failure—because every mistake is valuable "data" that will lead us to a better place than before.

## When the Four Factors Work Together {#relationship}

Iddhipada 4 doesn't work in isolation—it's a cycle that reinforces itself:

When we **love (Chanda)** → we will naturally and continuously **persevere (Viriya)** without even realizing it

When we persevere → our mind will **focus (Citta)** on that thing more easily

When the mind is focused → we see the details and develop **wisdom (Vimamsa)** to improve

And when everything improves, we will **love (Chanda)** it even more. It's a cycle of sustainable growth.

## Conclusion: Success as a Byproduct {#conclusion}

In the end, **Success**—or "achievement"—might not be a reward we receive when the work is done. It is a **"state of mind"** that we carry throughout the journey.

If you feel exhausted today, try pausing and gently exploring: among these four qualities, which one is missing? Or which one has become "too tight"? The Dharma doesn't tell us to become Superhuman who work tirelessly. It tells us to become humans who know how to manage our own "minds," so we can move forward with stability and happiness.

> "Success doesn't come from luck, but from a mind that loves, perseveres, stays focused, and keeps learning."
