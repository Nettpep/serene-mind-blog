# Serene Mind Blog — AI Constitution (Core)

- **Scope**: Implement what the user asked; avoid unrelated refactors.
- **Quality bar**: Prefer small, safe diffs; keep types sound; no broken builds.
- **Tooling**: Read before editing; after substantive edits run targeted lints.
- **Dependencies**: Do not add new packages unless clearly necessary; explain why.
- **Next.js/App Router**:
  - Default to **Server Components**; add `'use client'` only when needed.
  - Never pass event handlers from Server → Client props (split components).
- **i18n**: Preserve locale in links (`/${lang}/...`); no hardcoded Thai/English UI text when dictionary exists.
- **Performance**: Avoid heavy work on every request; cache filesystem/markdown work.
- **Security**: No secrets in repo; prefer env vars for keys/toggles/analytics IDs.
- **Git**: Do **not** commit/push unless the user explicitly asks.
